\item In a class of $40$ students ,marks obtained by the students in a class test \brak{out   of  10 } are given below:
	\begin{align*}
       \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
	       Marks& 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10\\
\hline
	       Number of students & 1 & 2 & 3 & 3 & 6 & 10 & 5 & 4 & 3 & 3\\

\text Calculate the following for the given distribution:
		\begin{enumerate}
        \item Median
		\item Mode

\item The data on the number of patients attending a hospital in a month are given below.
Find the average \brak{mean} number of patients attending the hospital in a month by using the shortcut method.
Take the assumed mean as $45$.Give your answer correct to $2$ decimal places.
		\begin{align*}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
	       Number of patients& 10-20 & 20-30 & 30-40 & 40-50 & 50-60 & 60-70\\
\hline
	       Number of Days & 5 & 2 & 7 & 9 & 2 & 5\\

\item There are $25$ discs numbered $1$ to $25$. They are put in a closed box and shaken thoroughly. A disc is drawn at random from the box.\\
Find the probability that the number on the disc is:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item an odd number
    \item divisible $2$ and $3$ both.
    \item a number is less than $16$.
\end{enumerate}

\item Use graph for this question.\\

       \text Draw the ogive and hence,estimate:
       \begin{enumerate}
           \item the median marks.
           \item the number of students who did not pass the pass percentage was $50$.
           \item the upper quartile marks.
